# Weatherizr

This is an app that I am working on, called Weatherizr.  The user searches for cities, and adds them to a convenient list that the user can later refer back to get weather information in their chosen cities.  It uses just HTML5/CSS3/javascript and uses npm+webpack+scss+babel as build tools.  It also utilizes react.js as the frontend view library.  For this project, I spent less than 8 hours on development, to show what I could accomplish in a relatively short timeframe.
